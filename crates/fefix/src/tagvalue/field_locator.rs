/// message. Repeating groups, however, break this promise and allow *multiple*
/// values with the same tag, each in a different *group entry*. This means that
/// a FIX message is a tree rather than an associative array. [`FieldLocator`]
/// generates unique identifiers for tags both outside and within groups, which
/// allows for random (i.e. non-sequential) reads on a FIX message.
